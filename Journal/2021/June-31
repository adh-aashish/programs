Hopeless. 
Thousand times I've tried to change and thousand times I've failed. 
How can one change fundamentally? Is it even possible to change oneself fundamentally?
But without change I'm doomed. 
Do I really want to change?
Do I really see the necessity of the change?
Or, am I just superficial?

Another day, another attempt to change.
