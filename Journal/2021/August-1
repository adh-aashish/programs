Repetition of pattern

Its been so many years that I recall, I've been repititing the same pattern day in and day out.
Everyday although is slightly different but on a large scale is the same because of the repition
of the pattern that I've built over the years. 
Everyday the question remains the same.
What will make me change? Change from the pattern of repeatition of the same old habit.
Everyday I'm in the same rut.
