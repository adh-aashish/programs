A week ago I was tested positive for covid. All my family have tested positive for covid. 
I spend my days consuming online media. Youtube, Series, Facebook, TikTok and what not.
I'm tired of this self. Or am I? If I was actually fed up of this, I would actually have 
changed.
Let's say I'm just in conflict with this self.
I want to change. 
I dont know how serious I'm. But I have decided to change things around.
I wont be consuming this much media from now.
I dont know what I'll be doing.
I do have to acquire some skills like programming to run my life or to earn a living.
My concern now will be gathering programming skills. I have to be good else I will be working on a
corporate and it doesnt seem to be fun.
I'm thinking for a startup idea that I can code. But I donot have the necessary skills. So now I will
be concerned on acquiring such skills.
